considered and the remaining sentence may be cancelled.3. If the sentence imposed upon a juvenile offender is a fine but he/she is facing prolonged 
financial hardship due to a natural disaster, conflagration, accident, or disease, or has made 
reparation in an effort to atone for the crime, the court, at the request of Director of the 
Procuracy, might exempt him/her from paying the remaining fine.
