Article 24. Infliction of bodily harm while capturing criminals 
1. If violence and infliction of bodily harm to a criminal is the only way to capture him/her, the 
use of violence in this case does not constitute a criminal offence. 
2. If the bodily harm inflicted by the use of violence is obviously more than necessary, the 
person who inflicts such damage shall bear criminal responsibility.
