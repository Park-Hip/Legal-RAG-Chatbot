Article 87. Combination of punishments of multiple judgments 
1. If a corporate legal entity that is serving a sentence is tried for a criminal offence committed 
before such sentence is imposed, the Court shall decide the sentence for the criminal offence 
being tried, and then the combined sentence as prescribed in Article 86 hereof. 
The duration of the previous sentence that is suspension of operation, prohibition from operating 
in certain fields, or prohibition from raising capital shall be deducted from that of the combined 
sentence. 
2. When a corporate legal entity that is serving a sentence commits a new criminal offence, the 
Court shall decide the sentence for the new offence, then aggregate it with the unserved part of 
the sentence to make the combined sentence as prescribed in Article 86 hereof.  
3. If a corporate legal entity is serving multiple sentences that are not combined, the executive 
judge of the Court shall issue a decision on a combined sentence as prescribed in Clause 1 and 
Clause 2 of this Article.
