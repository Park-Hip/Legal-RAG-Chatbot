Article 64. Commutation under special circumstances 
If the convict deserves further leniency (he/she has made reparation in an effort to atone for the 
crime, is too old and weak, or has a fatal disease), the Court may consider giving a commutation 
sooner or at a greater degree than those set out in Article 63 hereof.
